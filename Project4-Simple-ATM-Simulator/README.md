Objective: Create a small program that simulates basic ATM operations with input validation.

Requirements:

User Account:

Start with a hardcoded account balance (e.g., 1000).

Operations:

Deposit money

Withdraw money

Check balance

Validation Rules:

Deposit: Must be a positive number.

Withdraw: Must be a positive number and cannot exceed the current balance.

Menu choice: Must be a valid option (1, 2, 3, etc.).

Behavior:

Show a menu of options to the user:

1. Deposit
2. Withdraw
3. Check Balance
4. Exit


Ask the user for a choice and validate it.

Perform the chosen operation with proper input validation.

Repeat until the user chooses to exit.

Optional Enhancements:

Track transaction history and display it.

Add a PIN validation before accessing the account.

Allow multiple users with different balances.

This project is excellent because it lets you practice:

Validating numeric input

Looping through options repeatedly

Conditional logic

Basic arithmetic and state management
